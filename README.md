# LSTM for Stock Market Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained and evaluated using real-world stock market data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
